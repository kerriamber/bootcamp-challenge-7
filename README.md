## Description
This project uses `@inquirer/prompts` to query the user for project info, and generates a professional README based on the input. I chose to use `@inquirer/prompts` instead of `inquirer` because it is more performant than `inquirer` and `inquirer` is no longer actively developed.

The program makes sure all input is valid, i.e. none of the inputs are empty and the email input is a (mostly) valid email address.

## Installation
Clone the repo and run `npm -i` to install the needed packages.

## Usage
Run `npm run start` to run the program.

## Contributing
